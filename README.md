**Code for analysis of microtubule position in STED images of plasmodium sporozoites.**

This repository includes example code for STED microscopy analysis of sporozoites to locate there microtubules and infere the position of the separated microtubule.

üì¶ **Data for running and testing the code** can be found at the [associated dataset repository](https://doi.org/10.11588/DATA/4YBYXE).
